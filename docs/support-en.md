## Troubleshooting

**Subscriptions disappeared after reinstalling the app**
: Subctrl stores every record locally. Make sure iCloud/device backups are enabled before deleting the app. If you already removed it, there is no remote copy to restore.

**Notifications stopped firing**
: Open iOS Settings > Notifications > Subctrl and re-enable alerts. Then open the Support tab inside the app to re-register reminders.

## Reporting bugs or requesting features

1. Check existing issues to avoid duplicates.
2. When filing a new issue, include:
   - iOS version and device model.
   - App version/build (found at Settings → About).
   - Steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior.
   - Logs if available (use `flutter logs` while reproducing on a simulator).
3. Mark the issue as `bug`, `enhancement`, or `question` so it can be triaged.
